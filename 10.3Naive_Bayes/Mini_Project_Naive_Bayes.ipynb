    "# Basic Text Classification with Naive Bayes\n",
    "***\n",
    "In the mini-project, you'll learn the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. You'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on [Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab10) class.  Please free to go to the original lab for additional exercises and solutions."

    "The histogram looks bimodal, which implies that most critics choose a 'style'; some like to rate movies highly and some like to rate movies badly. I think this has to do with critics not wanting to be neutral about movies because that doesn't attract people to a movie nor does it let them know that a movie is bad. From this histogram, I hypothesize that the critics that rate movies badly on average seek out movies that they think will be bad, and their audience appreciates them for it, and vice versa for the critics who seek out good movies. It's also possible that some critics are just positive and will rate any movie they see as good, and some are negative and will rate any movie they see as bad."

    "Let us define the vector derived from document $d$ by $\\bar V(d)$. What does this mean? Each document is treated as a vector containing information about the words contained in it. Each vector has the same length and each entry \"slot\" in the vector contains some kind of data about the words that appear in the document such as presence/absence (1/0), count (an integer) or some other statistic. Each vector has the same length because each document shared the same vocabulary across the full collection of documents -- this collection is called a *corpus*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the vocabulary, we take a union of all words we have seen in all documents. We then just associate an array index with them. So \"hello\" may be at index 5 and \"world\" at index 99.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "`A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.`\n",

    "$V = \\left\\{\\right.$ `a, along, and, as, at, beautiful, branches, bunch, burst, day, fox, fox's, from, gazed, grapes, hanging, he, juice, longingly, mouth, of, one, ready, ripe, seemed, spied, the, them, to, trained, tree, vine, watered, with`$\\left.\\right\\}$\n",

    "Then, a set of documents becomes, in the usual `sklearn` style, a sparse matrix with rows being sparse arrays representing documents and columns representing the features/words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this representation loses the relative ordering of the terms in the document. That is \"cat ate rat\" and \"rat ate cat\" are the same. Thus, this representation is also known as the Bag-Of-Words representation.\n",

    "Such a matrix is also catted a Term-Document Matrix. Here, the terms being indexed could be stemmed before indexing; for instance, `jealous` and `jealousy` after stemming are the same feature. One could also make use of other \"Natural Language Processing\" transformations in constructing the vocabulary. We could use Lemmatization, which reduces words to lemmas: work, working, worked would all reduce to work. We could remove \"stopwords\" from our vocabulary, such as common words like \"the\". We could look for particular parts of speech, such as adjectives. This is often done in Sentiment Analysis. And so on. It all depends on our application.\n",

    "$P(c)$ is called the *prior* and is simply the probability of seeing class $c$. But what is $P(f \\vert c)$? This is the probability that we see feature set $f$ given that this document is actually in class $c$. This is called the *likelihood* and comes from the data. One of the major assumptions of the Naive Bayes model is that the features are *conditionally independent* given the class. While the presence of a particular discriminative word may uniquely identify the document as being part of class $c$ and thus violate general feature independence, conditional independence means that the presence of that term is independent of all the other words that appear *within that class*. This is a very important distinction. Recall that if two events are independent, then:\n",

This means that $P(f_i \\vert c) = 0$ for that term, and thus $P(f \\vert c)  = \\prod_i P(f_i | c) = 0$, which doesn't help us at all. Instead of using zeros, we add a small negligible value called $\\alpha$ to each count. This is called Laplace Smoothing.\n",

    "In the standard `CountVectorizer` model above, we used just the term frequency in a document of words in our vocabulary. In TF-IDF, we weight this term frequency by the inverse of its popularity in all documents. For example, if the word \"movie\" showed up in all the documents, it would not have much predictive value. It could actually be considered a stopword. By weighing its counts by 1 divided by its overall frequency, we downweight it. We can then use this TF-IDF weighted features as inputs to any classifier. **TF-IDF is essentially a measure of term importance, and of how discriminative a word is in a corpus.** There are a variety of nuances involved in computing TF-IDF, mainly involving where to add the smoothing term to avoid division by 0, or log of 0 errors. The formula for TF-IDF in `scikit-learn` differs from that of most textbooks: \n",
