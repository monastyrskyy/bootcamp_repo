This is a mock problem that I used to guide my data science lifecycle for this project.


I want to give those looking to sell their used cars the opportunity to get an idea of how much their car is worth based on a lot of data from a car sales website. Ultimately, the user would input his or her carâ€™s features and will then receive an estimate for how much the model thinks the car is worth.

By scraping car ad data online, I trained and tuned several regressors such as Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression, as well as a Random Forest and an XGBoost model. The XGBoost was the best performing model.
